#### Features:
- share stops of different means of transportation (bus, tram, trolley and sightseeing tours) on the same road segment to create more realistic exchange stops
- improved stop selection on roads with multiple platforms 

> this likely won't improve the overall traffic situation in your cities, it's more of a mod to increase transport realism and recreate stops like [this](https://images.pond5.com/tram-and-bus-stop-central-footage-126621279_iconl.jpeg) or [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/20200202_Tram_and_bus_stop_%22Urdenbacher_Allee%22_07.jpg)
